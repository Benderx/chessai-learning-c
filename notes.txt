	white is 1

probable bug:
	// curr_piece = // LOOKUP VAL -> pointer to piece val on that square
	    int curr_piece = (curr_piece | bb_end) & (UINT64_MAX-bb_start);
	why curr_piece | with itself
	before it is assigned to anything
	i think theres a logic error there, its in Engine::push_move
	happens again here,         // taken_piece = //LOOKUP VAL -> pointer to piece val on that square
	        taken_piece = taken_piece & (UINT64_MAX-bb_end);
