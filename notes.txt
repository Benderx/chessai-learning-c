    white is 1

REFRACTORING UPDATES
Added bit_operations.cpp file for engine functions relying solely on bit manipulation
Added printing.cpp file for debugging with prints and file manipulations
Is it bad form to have bit_operations take from bitboard.h? Bitboard. h is implemented through bitboard.cpp and anouther file
Changes to Engine::fill_diag_left_mask_arr() and Engine::fill_diag_right_mask_arr()
Updated Engine::remove_piece logic -> Added returns, doublecheck


READIBILITY:
Engine::fill_square_masks() - What is temp??
Engine::get_bitboard_of_piece is this incomplete or king specifc?
Engine::get_piece_by_bitboard What is board? Possibly misleading. What is going on here
Engine::get_attackers_blocks - Can probably do something about the names info[0] info[1] and info[2]


PREFORMANCE:
Adding const good or bad? Compiler can make assumptions buit in functions causes conversion?
Engine::piece_type_to_string - sort cases by probability of each 


COMPILE WITH:

g++ bitboard.hpp bitboard.cpp player.hpp player.cpp play.cpp move_generation.cpp piece_logic.cpp bit_operations.cpp printing.cpp -std=c++14 -o run

g++ bitboard.hpp bitboard.cpp player.hpp player.cpp play.cpp move_generation.cpp piece_logic.cpp bit_operations.cpp printing.cpp -std=c++14 -O3 -funroll-loops -Wall -Wno-unused-variable -Wno-unused-value -Wno-comment -Wno-unused-but-set-variable -Wno-maybe-uninitialized  -o run

First square (bottom left) is square 0

pre_check_one_bishop_moves:
    original code:
        // unsigned long long line_mask = diagonalMaskEx[bishop_square]; // excludes square of slider
        // unsigned long long slider = singleBitboard[bishop_square]; // single bit 1 << sq, 2^sq

        // unsigned long long forward = own_occupied & line_mask; // also performs the first subtraction by clearing the s in o
        // unsigned long long reverse = byteswap(forward); // o'-s'
        // forward = forward - slider; // o -2s
        // reverse = reverse - byteswap(slider); // o'-2s'
        // forward = forward ^ byteswap(reverse);
        // return forward & line_mask;      // mask the line again

        look into https://ubuntuforums.org/showthread.php?t=1190710 for byteswap


probable bug:
    // curr_piece = // LOOKUP VAL -> pointer to piece val on that square
        int curr_piece = (curr_piece | bb_end) & (UINT64_MAX-bb_start);
    why curr_piece | with itself
    before it is assigned to anything
    i think theres a logic error there, its in Engine::push_move
    happens again here,         // taken_piece = //LOOKUP VAL -> pointer to piece val on that square
            taken_piece = taken_piece & (UINT64_MAX-bb_end);

Current enhancement list:
minimax ai'
GUI for watching games
human interactable
continue to benchmark functions
realistic inputs
